Ride-Sharing System – OOP Java Project

This project is a console-based ride-sharing system developed using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It simulates the interaction between users, drivers, rides, and locations in a simplified ride-hailing service.

🔧 Developed by Md. Saib Hossain as a mid-term assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course.

Features
✅ User and Driver Registration
✅ Ride Request from One Location to Another
✅ Driver Availability and Ride Acceptance
✅ Ride Completion Management
✅ Error Handling (e.g., duplicate IDs, unavailable drivers, re-completing rides)
✅ In-memory data management using collections

🧪 Test Cases Covered
Basic Ride Flow:
Register user & driver
Request ride
Driver accepts and completes the ride
Edge Case Handling:
Driver unavailable
Re-completion of already completed ride
Duplicate registration IDs

📌 How to Run

Step 1: 
Clone the repository: 

    git clone https://github.com/Saibhossain/Ride-SharingService.git

Step 2 :
javac *.java
java Main
(💡 Ensure you have JDK installed. )

🎓 Learning Outcomes
Strong understanding of Java Classes & Objects
Implementation of Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Error Handling
Real-world simulation using clean OOP design

🙏 Thank You
Thank you for taking the time to explore my project. This assignment was a great opportunity to apply core Object-Oriented Programming principles in a real-world simulation. I’m grateful for the learning journey and excited to keep building meaningful projects like this.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to connect!
